SFM tool suite
==============

The SFM tool suite allows to model and use service feature models (SFMs) with the goal of representing and selecting software service variants.
The architecture consists of the following parts (as illustrated in the figure):

* **SFM designer**
  The SFM designer is the modeling environment to create and edit SFMs.
  It is based upon Eclipse and implemented using the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).

* **Valuation server**
  The valuation server exposes preference-based ranking for participatory selection of variants represented in an SFM.

* **Collaboration server**
  The collaboration server handles the coordination required for asynchronous collaboration in service feature modeling.

* **Interaction platform**
  The interaction platform provides user interfaces allowing stakeholders to express their preferences with respect to an SFMâ€™s attribute types.
  The interaction platform is not published here.
